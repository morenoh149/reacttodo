# Tictail hack V 1.0

## The mission
To build a simple client side todo application according to the attached PSD.
![Todilo Design](./todilo.png)

## Libraries
We'd __love__ to see that the application utilizes Backbone.js <http://backbonejs.org>

Feel free to throw in any library that you like. Here are some that we've used previously, but none of them are required:

* Yeoman <http://yeoman.io>
* Require.js <http://requirejs.org>
* Mustache templates <http://http://mustache.github.com> or <http://handlebarsjs.com>
* Backbone local storage <https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage>

## Bare bones functionality

* A page is designed to match the attached PSD
* Understand the design and implements features accordingly
* A suitable Backbone model or equivalent for todo items
* A suitable Backbone model collection or equivalent for todo items

## Extended functionality
* The application has a responsive design
* The todo items are persistent on the client side
* The necessary application files are served minified
* Things we have not thought of ourselves


## Delivery
The application should be delivered as a ```git``` repository, preferably hosted on GitHub <https://github.com/>.
